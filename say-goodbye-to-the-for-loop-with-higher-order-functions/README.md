# Say Goodbye to the For Loop with Higher Order Functions

Pssst, want to know a secret? I have not written a for loop in years. In fact I kind of forgotten what the syntax for one looks like. What's my secret? Higher Order Functions. Believe it or not for just about everything you are currently doing with for loops someone has already written, optimized, and tested a Higher Order Function that does the exact same thing. In this session we'll look at how to use Higher Order Functions to achieve all of your looping needs. We'll look at using map to do transformations. Using filter to trim narrow down our collections. We'll use fold to apply calculations. You'll walk away knowing how to apply Higher Order Functions to your every day coding and you'll finally be able to say good bye to the for loop.
