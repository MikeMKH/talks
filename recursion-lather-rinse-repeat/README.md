# Recursion - Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

Why did the programmer run out of shampoo?
The instructions on the bottle were: Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

It in this session we'll look at how to harness the power of recursion to make our lives easier. We'll look at primitive recursion with Peano arithmetic. Next we&#39;ll look at the most powerful Inductively defined data structure in the world, the con list. Lastly we&#39;ll look at how to solve problems using structural and generative recursion. You'll walk away with a new understanding of how to break down a problem using recursion.
